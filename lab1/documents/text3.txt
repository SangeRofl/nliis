Tuscarawas Valley High School seniors John W. Mosley and Jeffery D. Worrell, both 18, and sophomore Katelyn Owens, 15, were killed, said district superintendent Derek Veransky. (Authorities previously provided a different spelling of Mosley’s name.) Three adults – teacher Dave Kennat, 56, and parents Kristy Gaynor, 39, and Shannon Wigfield, 45 – were following the bus in a separate vehicle and also died, school and highway patrol officials said.
